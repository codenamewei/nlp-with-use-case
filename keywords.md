Every domain has it's commonly used terms/phrases.  
Below is an non-exhaustive list covering important keywords in Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

### General
- corpus
- word embedding/word vector/word representation
- one-hot encoding
- stopwords
- Out of Vocabulary (OOV)
- attention
- language model/modelling
- downstream task
- negative sampling
- hierarchical softmax
- auto-regressive
- auto-encoding
- lexical-database
- self-supervised learning
- causal language model
- sequence-to-sequence (seq-to-seq)
- extrinsic<>instrinsic evaluation
- tokenizer/tokenization
- window-based neural model
- domain mismatch


### Algorithm
- Term Frequency â€” Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
